What's up! My name is Julian Feliciano (if you didn't notice it *blatantly* on
every page title) and I love **code**. More specifically, I love to create
applications that are both fun and useful. At the moment I'm attending the
[Turing School of Software &amp; Design](https://www.turing.io/) in beautiful
Denver, CO where I am learning full stack web development. On the side you'll
find me either messing around with my environment setup (Team ZSH!) or learning
Node.js.

Besides coding, you can find me perusing the pages of
[Hodinkee](http://www.hodinkee.com/) and
[Worn &amp; Wound](http://wornandwound.com/), attempting to listen to every
single piece of music **ever** created, *drooling* over classic cars on
[Petrolicious](http://petrolicious.com/) and keeping up to date with current
social issues on twitter. If you want to get in contact with me or just chat it
up you can find me on twitter at [@julsfelic](https://twitter.com/julsfelic) or
email me at [julsfelic@gmail.com](mailto:julsfelic@gmail.com).

Have a good one!
