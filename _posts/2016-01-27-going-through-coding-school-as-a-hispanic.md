title: Going Through Coding School As A Hispanic
---

Roughly eight months ago I made the decision to make software development my career. This decision came fairly easy. Since I can remember I’ve had a *very* close relationship with computers growing up. Born and raised in the inner-city of Chicago, my parents were always weary about having me play on the streets without supervision. So as a substitute, they purchased a computer to occupy my time when they were not able to watch me. Tech opened up the world to me when I couldn’t interact with the world just outside my house.

Though the choice to go into tech was easy, figuring out *which* path to take was not. College? Self-teaching? Coding school? It was extremely overwhelming. While researching my options, I realized a question that I constantly asked myself:

> What are these schools actively doing to help underrepresented groups in the tech industry?

A common theme was many of the coding schools I researched made it know that they wanted to help the diversity issue present in tech. Though great in theory, how genuine were they being?

Through much research and deliberation I decided on the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://www.turing.io/) in Denver, CO.  Let me take you through the whole process, from applying to attending, and how Turing creates an environment that is welcoming to every and any background.

## Actively Making Contact

During my research into coding schools, [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek), founder of the [CodeNewbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/) community had just done a podcast with [Jeff Casimir](https://twitter.com/j3), founder of the Turing School. The interview touched on many subjects, but one that stood out to me was Jeff's experience in the tech world along with his background in being apart of Teach For America. Having both backgrounds helped ease a major concern for me about *how* I would be taught and if they understood the techniques to teach programming. Another things that caught my eye was Jeff starting Turing as a Non-Profit and his belief that tech could benefit from people that come from different backgrounds. Needless to say it was a great initial impression for me.

There was still an ounce of skepticism before I made the decision to apply. Many tech companies at the time were making their push for diversity in tech, with little results to show. Was Turing yet another hollow attempt towards the push for diversity? My fears would soon melt away when Jeff actively contacted me on twitter to apply.

I like to joke that people that grow up in the city have a “bullshit radar” that allows us to tell how genuine someone is. It never went off for Jeff, and gave me the confidence to apply. Making it through the first round of the application, next came the Google Hangout interview. As the video chat came up on my computer, I knew Turing was the school for me.

## Wait! I’m Being Interviewed By Hispanic?

The person that appeared on my screen was [Jorge Tellez](https://twitter.com/novohispano), Director Of Growth & Operation for Turing. What made this such an eye opening experience for me was the fact that not only did Turing have a hispanic on their team, he was also in a leadership role! It was honestly a *sigh* of relief.

While teaching myself programming and interacting with other developers on twitter, I noticed a sever lack of hispanics anywhere in the tech industry. It did not instill a ton of confidence on my prospects as a Puerto Rican in tech. That has always been a tough pill for me to swallow.

> “I know there are tons of smart, brilliant and more than capable hispanics out there. Why can’t I find them in tech?”

The thing is though there might not be nearly enough hispanics in tech, but the ones that have broken through are doing exceptional things. Jorge was an amazing representative of what Turing stood for. Not only did they want to help underrepresented groups with their career, they were actively apart of helping solve the diversity problem.

Currently, more than half of Turing’s staff are women, and in general, it is one of the most diverse group of people I’ve seen in the tech industry. Knowing what the school and staff stood for, all that was left was to meet the other 28 students that would be attending school.

## Many Different Backgrounds, One Family

Family. That is the first word I think of when I think of the group of students that are attending Turing. Race, religion, color and sex, none of them prevent us from treating each other as equals. The thing is, the title of this post is a misnomer. Going through a coding school as a hispanic is just going through a coding school.

When Turing selects students, the select them not only for their aptitude to learn programming, but also because they see people that want to help make the world a better place for everyone. From carpenters to nurses, rocket scientists to teachers, investment bankers to forklift drivers (that’s me!) we all have different experiences to bring to this industry.

Turing is not alone. My feeling is that many of the top coding schools today are not only creating amazing software developers, but also amazing people. People that are going to change the landscape of tech for good. I entered as a hispanic from Chicago, driving forklifts for a living. And will be leaving as a software developer looking to help pave the way for the people that come after me.
